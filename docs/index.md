# Welcome to PyAction!

PyAction helps you to develop custom GitHub Actions using Python. This documentation covers a tutorial and a demo hello-world action. Head to [Quickstart](quickstart.md) to see the demo project and create an action in a flash. :zap:

## Easy to Setup
Make sure you have `pip` and `python>=3.8` installed on your machine and install `pyaction`.

```
pip install -U pyaction
```

Now, execute the following command to see all the subcommands and options.
```
pyaction --help
```

!!! Example "It's recommended to.."
    Initialize a basic template and provide yourself a nicely put-to-gether action structure for starting.

    ```
    pyaction init
    ```

Here you can see a very basic greeting action example that prints a greeting message when someone calls it with a `name` input parameter.

=== ":simple-python: your-action/main.py"

    ```py
    import sys
    from typing import List

    from pyaction import io


    def main(args: List[str]) -> None:
        """main function

        Args:
            args: STDIN arguments
        """

        name = io.read("name")

        io.write(
            {
              "phrase": f"Hi {name}!"
            }
        )


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main(sys.argv[1:])

    ```

=== ":simple-github: .github/workflows/ci.yml"

    ```yaml hl_lines="16-18 21"
    name: Greeting Action

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main

    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        name: Running the action
        steps:
          - name: Greetings
            id: greetings
            uses: you/your-action
            with:
              name: Sadra

          - name: Output
            run: echo ${{ steps.greetings.outputs.phrase }}
    ```

```plaintext title="Output" linenums="1"
â–¶ Run echo Hi Sadra!
Hi Sadra!
```

Since `pyaction` is part of your action's dependencies, you have access to utilities that enable you to work with the repository/workflow information. You can find out more about these utils on the [Tutorial](tutorial.md) page.

## How It Works
Custom GitHub Actions can be developed in different ways. PyAction uses the [Docker Container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions#docker-container-actions) method which is highly stable with Python environments. This way, you'll be able to specify the requirements for your actions and run them inside a lightweight isolated container with all the dependencies installed.

If you're interested in the idea and want to help, your contribution is welcome as always. Check out the [Contribution Guide](contributing.md) for more information.
