# Welcome to PyAction Cookiecutter
PyAction is a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.io) template that allows you to develop GitHub Actions using Python language. This documentation covers a fundamental overview about the project, a hello-world example, and the deployment to [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).

## Introduction
Custom GtiHub Actions can be made in the following ways.

* Docker-based Actions
* Javascript Actions
* Composite Actions

PyAction is based on the Dockerfile implementation that GitHub recommends and has some workflow-related features that allow you to have access to the variables and data transferring during your workflow executions.

!!! Note
    For more information about the theory behind PyAction, I've written [Writing GitHub Actions in Python](https://imsadra.me/writing-github-actions-in-python) article that gives you an accurate perspective that you can follow and find more about.
